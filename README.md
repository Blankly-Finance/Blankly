## Why Blankly? 

Blankly is an elegant python library for interacting with crypto, stocks, and forex for in a consistent and streamlined way. Now, no more reading API or struggling to get data. Blankly offers a powerful feature-set, optimized for speed and ease of use, better backtesting, and ultimately better models. 

We're bridging the gap between local development systems & live APIs by building a framework which allows backtesting, 
paper trading, sandbox testing, and live cross-exchange deployment without modifying a single line of trading logic.

Check out our [website](https://blankly.finance) and our [docs](https://docs.blankly.finance).

### Trade Stocks, Crypto, and Forex Seamlessly

```python
from blankly import Alpaca, CoinbasePro

stocks = Alpaca()
crypto = CoinbasePro()

# Easily perform the same actions across exchanges & asset types
stocks.interface.market_order('AAPL', 'buy', 10)
crypto.interface.market_order('BTC-USD', 'buy', 10)
```

### Backtest Instantly Across Symbols

```python
from blankly import Alpaca, Strategy, StrategyState

def price_event(price, symbol, state):
	# Trading logic here
  state.interface.market_order(symbol, 'buy', 10)
  
# Authenticate
alpaca = Alpaca()
strategy = Strategy(alpaca)

# Check price every hour and send to the strategy function
# Easily switch resolutions and data
strategy.add_price_event(price_event, 'AAPL', '1h')
strategy.add_price_event(price_event, 'MSFT', '15m')

# Run the backtest
strategy.backtest(to='1y')
```

## Quickstart

### Installation

1. First install Blankly using `pip`. Blankly is hosted on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Blankly/).

```bash
$ pip install blankly
```

2. Next, just run:
```bash
$ blankly init
```
This will initialize your working directory.

The command will create the files `keys.json`, `settings.json`, `backtest.json`, `deploy.json` and an example script called `bot.py`.

If you don't want to use our `init` command, you can find the same files in the `examples` folder under [`settings.json`](https://github.com/Blankly-Finance/Blankly/blob/main/examples/settings.json) and [`keys_example.json`](https://github.com/Blankly-Finance/Blankly/blob/main/examples/keys_example.json)

3. From there, **insert your API keys** from your exchange into the generated `keys.json` file.

More information can be found on our [docs](https://docs.blankly.finance)

### Directory format

The working directory format should have at least these files:
```
Project
   |-bot.py
   |-keys.json
   |-settings.json
```

#### Additional Info

Make sure you're using a supported version of python. The module is currently tested on these versions:

- Python 3.7+

For more info, and ways to do more advanced things, check out our [getting started docs](https://docs.blankly.finance).

## Supported Exchanges

| Exchange     | REST Support | Ticker Websocket | Order Book | Interface |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Coinbase Pro | 🟢           | 🟢               | 🟢        | 🟢        |
| Binance      | 🟢           | 🟢               | 🟢        | 🟢       |
| Alpaca       | 🟢         | 🟢             | 🟢      | 🟢        |
| OANDA | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 |

🟢  = working

🟡  = in development, some or most features are working

🔴  = planned but not yet in development

* Interface calls take ~300 µs extra to homogenize the exchange data.

## RSI Example

We have a pre-built cookbook examples that implement strategies such as RSI, MACD, and the Golden Cross found in our [examples](https://docs.blankly.finance/examples/golden-cross).

The model below will run an RSI check every 30 minutes - **buying** below **30** and **selling** above **70** .

```python
import blankly
from blankly import StrategyState


def price_event(price, symbol, state: StrategyState):
    """ This function will give an updated price every 15 seconds from our definition below """
    state.variables['history'].append(price)
    rsi = blankly.indicators.rsi(state.variables['history'])
    if rsi[-1] < 30:
        # Dollar cost average buy
        state.interface.market_order(symbol, side='buy', funds=10)
    elif rsi[-1] > 70:
        # Dollar cost average sell
        state.interface.market_order(symbol, side='sell', funds=10)


def init(symbol, state: StrategyState):
    # Download price data to give context to the algo
    state.variables['history'] = state.interface.history(symbol, to='1y', return_as='list')['open']


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Authenticate coinbase pro strategy
    coinbase_pro = blankly.CoinbasePro()

    # Use our strategy helper on coinbase pro
    coinbase_strategy = blankly.Strategy(coinbase_pro)

    # Run the price event function every time we check for a new price - by default that is 15 seconds
    coinbase_strategy.add_price_event(price_event, symbol='BTC-USD', resolution='30m', init=init)

    # Start the strategy. This will begin each of the price event ticks
    # coinbase_strategy.start()
    # Or backtest using this
    coinbase_strategy.backtest(to='1y')
```

### High Quality Backtest Result

### Run Live

Seamlessly run your model live!

```python
# Just turn this
coinbase_strategy.backtest(to='1y')
# Into this
coinbase_strategy.start()
```

Dates, times, and scheduling adjust on the backend to make the experience instant.
